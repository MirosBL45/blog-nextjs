Hello :)

This is Next.JS project for making blog. For database, I used hygraph.com

The appearance of the site was not primary in this project.

The primary thing was to create a good functionality of the blog that was created with Next.JS and hygraph.com

Added form for sending e-mail via service EmailJS on backend

Any advice is welcome :)
